## About the project ## 
---
This bot was created as my first project in Python.  
Before that I mostly scripted in PowerShell which is still my main language.  
Since discord.py is discontinued this only works for now (04.11.2021) and in the future the bot will be ported to a new lib and slash commands.  

## About the bot ## 
---
Most of the settings are configurable via the Settings.json, an example is provided.  
There are a few hardcoded checks, if you want your bot to work in every channel, you can just delete them.  
For some functionality like Twitch notifications, tokens are needed, this is also provided via an example file.  
Some stuff like the trash reminder is only for my personal use, the functionality is pretty simple but you will need to provide the file yourself.  
This is by all means a **fun** project and should not be considered for production enviroments.  

**THIS IS BY NO MEANS AN "OUT OF THE BOX" BOT, YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR HOW TO SET UP A DISCORD BOT TO USE THIS**  

## To Dos ##
